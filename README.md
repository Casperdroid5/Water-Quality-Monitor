# Water Quality Monitor

This document outlines my contribution to the Water Quality Monitor project during my internship at the Health Concept Lab.

## Overview

The Water Quality Monitor utilizes a Raspberry Pi running Raspbian as the main controller and computer, along with a custom-designed PCB for circuit layout. Hardware control, GUI, and data processing are implemented using Python.

## Design Process

The design process involved selecting suitable hardware components, designing the PCB layout, and programming the firmware in Python.

1. **Hardware Selection**: Chose appropriate sensors, actuators, and electronic components to suit the needs of the clients setup.
2. **PCB Design**: Created a custom PCB layout to ensure optimal circuit connections.
3. **Firmware Development**: Developed the firmware using Python to enable hardware communication.
## Testing

Comprehensive testing was conducted to ensure accuracy and reliability.

1. **Hardware Testing**: Verified proper functionality of each hardware component on the printed circuitboard.
2. **Software Testing**: Thoroughly tested firmware for peripherals.
