# Water Quality Monitor

This document outlines my contribution to the Water Quality Monitor project during my internship at the Health Concept Lab.

## Overview

The Water Quality Monitor utilizes a Raspberry Pi running Raspbian as the main controller and computer, along with a custom-designed PCB for circuit layout. Hardware control, GUI, and data processing are implemented using Python.

## Design Process

The design process involved selecting suitable hardware components, designing the PCB layout, and programming the firmware in Python.

1. **Hardware Selection**: Chose appropriate sensors, actuators, and electronic components.
2. **PCB Design**: Created a custom PCB layout to ensure optimal circuit connections.
3. **Firmware Programming**: Developed the firmware using Python to enable hardware communication, implement the GUI, and perform data processing.

## Testing

Comprehensive testing was conducted to ensure accuracy and reliability.

1. **Hardware Testing**: Verified proper functionality of each hardware component.
2. **Software Testing**: Thoroughly tested firmware, GUI, and data processing algorithms.

## Conclusion

My internship contribution to the Water Quality Monitor project included hardware selection, PCB design, and Python firmware programming. Testing was performed to ensure accurate and reliable measurements.

The Water Quality Monitor aims to provide a dependable solution for monitoring water quality and ensuring the safety of drinking water by combining hardware and software expertise.
